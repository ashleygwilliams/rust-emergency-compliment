## prerequisites

This application is written in the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).
Therefore to run this application you'll need Rust installed. If you do not already have Rust 
installed, I recommend using the (rustup)[https://www.rustup.rs/] Rust version manager to install it.

## up and running

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. cd `rust-oh-hai-internet`
3. `cargo run`

## dependencies

- [pencil](https://crates.io/crates/pencil/): A micro web framework for Rust, inspired by
  Python's flask.
